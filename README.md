- 👋 Hi, I’m @millerthegorilla
- 👀 I’m interested in strong AI and django.  I can program competently in python, html, css etc.  I can program in javascript with a little effort, I can typescript, c++, c, php, ruby and a bunch of others, with a little reading (having used them all before to a reasonably degree of competency).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I guess, but I am fairly busy.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
write it on a note and put it in the fireplace...
or better still send me a message here at github.
